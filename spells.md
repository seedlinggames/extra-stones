# Alternate spells and spell organization

*This is very much a work in progress*

This spell list is mostly motivated by trying to fit the Cairn spells into something that better fits my implied setting. I was doing this in a one-off way every time I tried doing something with spells, so I decided to organize it better here.

Spells marked with *#* are from the [Cairn SRD](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/), those marked with *@* are from [More Spellbooks](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/). When the symbol is in brackets, I have substantially rewritten the text. Spells that are entirely new are in italics.

Spells are not written in spellbooks. You just know them. I might figure out a specific way of limiting how many spells you can have later, but in general spells should be fairly rare. Some of the new spells are maybe wordy and would once have been relics - I kind of am not sure I want relics in my game to be separate from spells though, or rather I want to blur those categories. Related to maybe wanting to get rid of spellbooks. Some of these spells would also just be abilities in other games. I don't know. It's a work in progress.

The categories aren't meant to be balanced, or to be well defined "schools". They are more about organizing spells into themes so that I can easily select a random thematically appropriate spell for an NPC.

Most spells aren't something that players are likely to start with, and if they want to obtain, would have to figure out how. Hedge Magic is specifically intended for starting characters, but in several sections I've also suggested other spells you might want.


## Hedge magic 

Minor spells that do not quite rise to the level of witchcraft, but which are fairly common. Most of these are just barely more powerful than not using magic - in some cases I have written them to be less powerful. These are the sorts of spells a character might start with. 

1. **Animal Call** Summon a mundane beast that is close enough to hear your voice. It holds no loyalty towards you or your allies.  (@)
2. **Cleanse** 	Spoiled food becomes edible, and water becomes safe to drink. (@)
3. **Dreampoison** 	Target is deprived after suffering a night of bad dreams. You must whisper in their ear while they sleep. (@)
4. **Frozen Corpse** 	A corpse you touch is preserved for seven days. (@)
5. **Skillfull Repair** 	You make minor repairs to a nonliving object. The repairs hold for one hour for every five minutes you spend on it. (@)
6. **Find Virulence** 	Detect poison in any creature or object that you spend at least one minute examining. (@)
7. **Boundless Message** 	Delivers a single sentence to any one creature instantaneously, no matter the distance. @
8. TODO

## Witchcraft 

These are what common people most think about as magic. Not well known, but not hidden away either: passed down through families in distant villages. Little tricks that regular people found useful through the years, to protect those they care about, harm those they hate, and sometimes just fulfill a dream, like flying or swimming. Curses are also often considered part of witchcraft, but can occur in other contexts too. Roll 1d8 if a character can start with one of these spells.

1. **Fish Lung** 	You can breathe underwater until you surface again. (@)
2. **Sniff** 	You can smell even the faintest traces of scents.  #
3. **Vermin Plague** 	Summons a swarm of bats, rats, spiders or similar creatures of your choice. They are harmless but distracting and hold no loyalty towards you or your allies. @
4. **Mirrorwalk** 	A mirror becomes a gateway to another mirror that you looked into today. Perfectly still pools of water work as well. (#)
5. **Cure-All** 	A single illness or disease dissipates at your touch. You are then Deprived until you take a full night's rest. (@)
6. **Scry** 	You can see through the eyes of a creature you touched earlier today.  # 
7.  **Hear Whispers** 	You can hear faint sounds clearly.  #
8. **Ill Fate** 	A creature that you touch automatically fails next their next save. (@)
9. **Swarm** 	You become a swarm of crows, rats, or piranhas. You can only be harmed by blast attacks.  #
10.  **Twilight Steed** 	Summons an arcane steed that never tires, but dissipates within daylight. @
11.  **Charm** A creature you can see treats you as a friend, as long as they are unaware of any overt ill-intent. (#)
12. **Raise Dead** 	A skeleton rises from the ground to serve you. They are incredibly stupid and can only obey simple orders.  #
13. **Read Mind** 	You can hear the surface thoughts of nearby creatures.  #
14. **Arcane Eye** You can see through a magical floating eyeball that flies around at your command. #
15. **Smoke Form** 	Your body becomes a living smoke that you can control.  #
16.  **Disassemble** 	Any of your body parts may be detached and reattached at will, without causing pain or damage. You can still control them. #
17. **Gift of Flight** 	You can fly for a short while. (@)
18.  **Animate Object** An object obeys your commands as best it can. #
19.  **Epidemic** 	Infects target with disease, which spreads until the source of magic is destroyed. @
20. **Plant Scourge** 	Plants within eyesight wither and die. @

## Curses, or the magic of the dead

They often come from gods or evil spirits, but mortals can learn to cast them as well. In rare cases, someone who has been truly wronged can call upon one of these at their moment of death. When cast under normal circumstances, they usually dissipate within 1d6 hours, but when cast by a god or a dying mortal they are permanent until the curse can be lifted. 

1. **Greed** 	A creature develops the overwhelming urge to possess an item of your choice.  (#)
2. **Hatred** 	A creature develops a deep hatred of another creature or group and wishes to destroy them.  #
3. **Phobia** 	A nearby creature becomes terrified of an object of your choice.  #
4. **Calcify** 	Target object turns to stone at the caster’s touch. Living targets save vs STR. @
5. **Sinister Polymorph** 	WIL save or target is transformed into a harmless animal. @
6. ***Courage** A creature develops a reckless and dangerous fearlessness (inspired by Tannic)*
7. **Sleep** 	A creature you can see falls asleep. As long as they are asleep, they have no need for food, water or other bodily functions. They wake up if they take damage to STR. (#)
8. ***True Name** You (or your next of kin) learn the target's True Name. You know where the target was born, every name they have ever used, and can instinctively sense their location as though you had a compass which points to them.*

Sample characters:
- A ghost curses those who sleep by an old battlefield to carry on his long-forgotten battle and to deeply wish to destroy a nearby village and all those who travel there.
- TODO I was planning to do these for all the spell categories


## Thiefcraft 

These spells have been discovered or passed down in secret from master thief to master thief. They are rarely shared with outsiders. If you allow a character to start with one of these spells, roll 1d6 to select one.

1. **Disguise**	You may alter the appearance of one character at will as long as they remain humanoid. Attempts to duplicate other characters will seem uncanny. #
2. **Leap** You jump up to 10ft high, once.  #
3. **Snuff** The source of any mundane light you can see is instantly snuffed out.  # 
4. **Filch** A visible item teleports to your hands.  #
5. **Shroud** 	A creature you touch is invisible until they move.  #
6. **Auditory Illusion** 	You create illusory sounds that seem to come from a direction of your choice. #
7. **Knock** A nearby mundane or magical lock unlocks loudly.  #
8. **Thief’s Bane** An object appears trapped, even to an experienced thief. @
9.  **Energize Rope** A rope-like objects moves at your command. @
10. **Spider Climb** You can climb surfaces like a spider.  #
11. **Mental Tripwire** 	Intruders set off an alarm audible only to you. @
12. ***Silent Step** Your footsteps make no sound and leave no footprints, and are as light as a mouse - you don't set off any pressure-based traps.*


## Entertainment

These spells are largely associated with traveling entertainers.

1. **Flare** A bright ball of energy fires a trail of light into the sky, revealing your location to friend or foe.  #
2. **Spectacle** 	A clearly false but impressive illusion of your choice appears, under your control. It may be up to the size of a palace and has full motion and sound.  #
3. **Illuminate** 	A floating light moves as you command.  #
4. **Telekinesis**	You may mentally 1 move item under 60lbs.  #
5. **Firedancer** See below.
6. ***Pass object** You can teleport an object between your hands, your pockets, or another container on your person or within arm's reach, so long as it is not visible at the start or destination.*

Pass object is often used for scamming people, as well.


## Spells of authority

Of particular interest to those who wish to rule - either because they grant them power, or because it solves the problems that people expect those in power to have. Often, local authorities expect to maintain a monopoly on these types of spells. Roll 1d4 if a player can start with one of these.

1. **Identify Owner** 	Letters appear over the object you touch, spelling out the name of the object’s owners, if there are any.  #
2.  **Raise Spirit** 	The spirit of a nearby corpse manifests and will answer 1 question.  #
3. **Uncurse** 	A person or object you touch is freed from a curse or nefarious spell. You are deprived until your next full night's rest.(@)
4.  **Ward** 	A silver circle 50ft across appears on the ground. Choose one species that cannot cross it.  #
5. **Command** 	A target obeys a single three-word command that does not cause it harm. #
6. **Sense** 	Choose one kind of object (key, gold, arrow, jug, etc). You can sense the nearest example.  #
7. **Arcane Confinement** 	Target is bound by magical rope, able only to speak but nothing more. @
8. **Magic Dampener** 	All nearby magical effects have their effectiveness halved.  #
9. **Deafen** 	All nearby creatures are deafened. #
10. **Terrify** 	Targets within eyesight must pass a WIL save or flee. @


Sample NPCs:
- Horth, the traveling judge, knows how to identify the true owner of any object. He mostly uses this impressive trick to convince people to sit down and solve their problems honestly, though.
- Kalay, the head priestess, can dig up the old tablets on how to remove various curses, if needed.
- The warlord Xvil is said to be able to force her enemies to flee in terror by merely removing her mask.

## That which makes up the earth

Every part of nature operates because of the efforts of the gods and spirits: you, too, can learn to instruct nature, albeit on a smaller scale. They are fairly rare, though, as they are not always very useful and tend to cause problems for regular people. Someone who can cure a disease is popular; someone who creates earthquakes is not. It is not intended that PCs start with these, and obtaining them should be difficult.

I think spells that do elemental damange are frequently very underwhelming. You shouldn't be shooting bolts of fire for 1d6 damage, the ability to control fire should be terrifying. 

The intention is that they would be more commonly used by NPCs, think of them more like something that makes a monster threatening. PCs could then obtain them somehow after seeing them in action, but it wouldn't be easy. 

These are in some cases pretty wordy compared to most Cairn spells, and maybe are starting to move outside of "classic" Cairn. 

Plants
1. **Control Plants** 	Nearby plants and trees obey you and gain the ability to move at a slow pace. #
2. **Thicket** 	A thicket of trees and dense brush up to 50ft wide suddenly sprouts up.  #
3. ***Vegetal imprisonment** Nearby plants start to slowly wrap themselves around a target: grass weakly envelops your feet, vines wrap around you, branches encircle you and, if you're standing next to a tree, the trunk opens to swallow you up. After a day, you begin to transform into a tree.*

Water

1. **Fog Cloud** 	A dense fog spreads out from you.  #
2. **Upwell** 	A spring of water appears - fresh if there is fresh water nearby, salty if only seawater is available, or if you are far from any water source.  (#)
3. ***Flood** You strike the ground and a torrent of water appears. Underground spaces will be flooded in minutes, and creatures and loose objects will be swept away.*

Earth
1. **Pit** 	A pit 10ft wide and 10ft deep opens in the ground.  #
2. ***Stone walking** You may walk through stone or earth for as long as you can hold your breath. You cannot see where you are going. If you run out of air or otherwise die inside the stone, you turn into the material you were walking through.*
3. **Earthquake** The earth splits, walls crumble, cave walls cave in, and landslides occur. Everyone  nearby, including the caster, risks being swallowed by the earth (DEX check if no preparations were made). (#) TODO random table of effects

Weather

1. **Control Weather** 	You may alter the type of weather at will, but you do not otherwise control it. #
2. **Windborn** 	You direct a powerful wind in a straight line, strong enough to blow over small boulders. @
3. ***Lightning arrow** Fire an arrow of literal lightning that does 3d12 damage (taking the highest number) and makes a horiffically loud noise. Critical damage: you are vaporized. Everyone that looks at the arrow from 60 feet or closer, including the caster, is blinded for a day, and everyone within 60 feet who doesn't protect their ears is deafened for a day.*

Fire

1. ***Ash** A flammable object you touch crumbles into ash at a rate of one square foot per round from the place it was touched; can be stopped by immersing it in water. Does 1d6 damage to a living creature, and on a critical a limb is permamently burnt and unusable.*
2. ***Flaming sword** Bypasses armor and forces a morale save the first time someone is attacked. Anyone so killed cannot rise as undead. It stops when the weapon is sheathed or put down.*
3. **Wall of Fire** A straight wall of fire 50ft long and 10ft high rises from the ground. Alternately, it can be round, so long as you're in the middle of it.(#)

Winter

1. **Icy Touch** 	A thick ice layer spreads across a touched surface, up to 10ft in radius. Deals 1d6 DEX damage if you touch a creature's bare skin instead. (#)
2.	**Winter’s Woe** 	An icy storm assails multiple targets, obscuring visibility and making the ground icy and treacherous. @
3. ***Heart of Winter** The temperature drops precipitously. Frost forms on all surfaces. Water becomes ice. Anyone within 60 feet must make a DEX save to do anything involving fine motor control or to move fast. Anyone within 10 feet takes 1d8 damage. Critical damage: turned to ice.*


## Knowledge of the Self

Some people have discovered they can tap into the latent magic that powers all life, including that of mortals. Some unlock these abilities through years of training, through intense contemplation and study, or through ecstatic abandon. If player characters can start with one of these, it should be one of the first 4.

In terms of touchstones, this covers everything from berserkers, to the kinds of legendary martial artists that monks in conventional D&D are based on, to demigod heroes from myths and legends.

1. **Frenzy** 	You erupt in a frenzy of violence. You cannot fail morale checks and your attacks count as blasts, but you cannot retreat or make carefully considered decisions.  (#)
2. **Adaptive Skin** 	You can exist comfortably in hot or cold environments. (@)
3. **Haste** 	Your movement speed is tripled.  #
4.  ***Feat of Strength** Break something with your bare hands as though you were holding a large hammer, lift something as though ten people were helping you, or perform a single similar feat of strength. This makes you gain a slot of Fatigue.*
5. ***Firedancer** You wield fire with your bare hands. You deal 1d6 damage, counting as blast damage for everything within touch range, and burn through everything flammable except what you wear. It stops if you ever stop moving. It also looks really cool. If forced to stop moving in an abrupt and unexpected way, make a DEX save or catch fire, taking 1d6 damage directly to your strength and destroying anything flammable on your person.*
6.  **True Sight** 	You see through all nearby illusions.  #
7. ***Iron Skin** 	For one minute, bladed weapons dull against your skin (must be resharpened to be used) and do no damage. Other mundane attacks are impaired.   (note: this started as Shield #)*
8. ***Swift hands** For one minute, you can catch arrows mid-air. (note: needs a better name)* 

## From the Far Woods

Here, notions of truth and lies, of identity and form, become malleable. 

1. **Pacify** 	A creature near you has an aversion to violence.  #
2. **Masquerade** 	A characters appearance and voice becomes identical to those of a character you touch.  #
3. Opaque Cover 	Details about your person become obscured and unmemorable. @
4. **Visual Illusion** 	A silent, immobile, room-sized illusion of your choice appears.  #
5. **Vision** 	You completely control what a creature sees.  #
6. **Befuddle** 	A creature of your choice is unable to form new short-term memories for the duration of the spell. #
7. **Beast Form** 	You and your possessions transform into a mundane animal. #
8. **Anthropomorphize** An animal either gains human intelligence or human appearance for one day. #
9. **Beguilement** 	Target humanoid must make a WIL save or is controlled telepathically. @
10. **Mirror Image** 	An illusory duplicate of yourself appears and is under your control.  #
11. **Sculpt Elements** 	Inanimate material behaves like clay in your hands.  #
12. **Body Swap** 	You switch bodies with a creature you touch. If one body dies, the other dies as well. #


I need 6 more to add the following in:
- Bewildering Fog 	A hazy fog surrounds you in a radius of 20ft. Attacks within the mist are impaired. @
- Discern truth: For one hour, you can tell when someone is lying, and others can tell when you are lying. However, half-truths, misleading truths, and tricky wording can go undetected.

## Esoterica

These spells are strange and, unlike other spells, incongruous to the world, unknown to most gods, spirits or other supernatural beings. They have been discovered after generations of study in secret institutions, or perhaps in voyages to the edge of reality.

1. **Detect Magic** 	You can see the presence of magic, but everything non-magical is indistict and hard to see, as if viewed through a thick fog. (#) 
2.  **Comprehend** 	You become fluent in all languages for a short while. #
3.  **Night Sphere** 	A 50ft wide sphere of darkness displaying the night sky appears before you.  #
4. **Hover** 	An object hovers, frictionless, 2ft above the ground. It can hold up to one humanoid.  #
5. **Astral Prison** An object or being is frozen ouside of time and space in an invulnerable crystal shell. By studying the prison carefully for an extended period of time it is possible to reach in at right angles to reality and pull the object or being out. (#) 
6. **Astral Step** 	You and anyone touching you instantly transport to a known location you have been to before. @
7. **Architect’s Perfection** 	Create a holographic wall, floor, or ceiling that looks absolutely real. @
8. **Fold Portal** 	A door you touch opens into another door you’ve stepped through before until it is shut again. @
9. **Passage** 	Creates a temporary passage through wood, stone or brick. @
10. **Phase Anchor** Summons and binds to your will a creature unknown to this world. After performing any specified task, it may pass a WIL save to escape. (@)
11. ***Slip outside time** You medidate for an hour and gain 1 fatigue. You may then in the future rewind time 10 seconds, once.*
12. ***Open minds** By gazing into someone's eyes, you grant someone a vision of a truth of the universe mortal minds were not meant to see. The target is stunned for an hour and afterwards will either fearfully avoid it or become obsessed with it. (inspired by a similar spell in blades in the dark)*
