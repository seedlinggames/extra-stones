# Alternate spells and spell organization

*This is very much a work in progress**

This spell list is mostly motivated by trying to fit the Cairn spells into something that better fits my implied setting. I was doing this in a one-off way every time I tried doing something with spells so I decided to organize it better here.

Spells marked with # are from the [Cairn SRD](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/), those marked with @ are from [More Spellbooks](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/more-spellbooks/). When the symbol is in brackets, I have substantially rewritten the text. Spells that are entirely new are in italics.

Spells are not written in spellbooks. You just know them. I might figure out a specific way of limiting how many spells you can have later, but in general spells should be fairly rare.

I think spells that do elemental damange are frequently very underwhelming. I created a bunch of new ones that generally should be hard to obtain and 


TODO which ones can you actually start with - divide them into subcategories. Some of these should be things you can roll as a starting character, others are more associated with antagonists (who, if defeated, might allow you to gain their power sometimes), others might involve some large quest to recieve.

Some of the new spells are maybe wordy and would once have been relics - I kind of am not sure I want relics in my game to be separate from spells though, or rather I want to blur those categories. Related to maybe wanting to get rid of spellbooks.


## Hedge magic 

Minor spells that do not quite rise to the level of witchcraft, but which are fairly common.
Most of these are just barely more powerful than not using magic - in some cases I have written them to be less powerful.

1. **Animal Call** Summon a mundane beast that you already know to be nearby. It holds no loyalty towards you or your allies.  (@)
2. **Cleanse** 	Spoiled food becomes edible, and water becomes safe to drink. (@)
3. **Dreampoison** 	Target is deprived after suffering a night of bad dreams. You must whisper in their ear while they sleep. (@)
4. **Frozen Corpse** 	A corpse you touch is preserved for seven days. (@)
5. **Skillfull Repair** 	You make minor repairs to a nonliving object. The repairs hold for one hour for every minute you spend on it. (@)
6. **Find Virulence** 	Detect poison in any creature or object that you spend at least one minute examining. (@)

7. **Boundless Message** 	Delivers a single sentence to any one creature instantaneously, no matter the distance. @
8. TODO


## Witchcraft 

These are what common people most think about as magic. Not well known, but not hidden away either: passed down through families in distant villages. Little tricks that regular people found useful through the years, to protect those they care about, harm those they hate, and sometimes just fulfill a dream, like flying or swimming. Curses are also often considered part of witchcraft, but can occur in other contexts too.

1. **Animate Object** An object obeys your commands as best it can. #
2. **Arcane Eye** You can see through a magical floating eyeball that flies around at your command. #
3. **Charm** A creature you can see treats you as a friend. #
4. **Disassemble** 	Any of your body parts may be detached and reattached at will, without causing pain or damage. You can still control them. #
5. **Mirrorwalk** 	A mirror becomes a gateway to another mirror that you looked into today. Perfectly still pools of water work as well. (#)
6. **Raise Dead** 	A skeleton rises from the ground to serve you. They are incredibly stupid and can only obey simple orders.  #
7. **Read Mind** 	You can hear the surface thoughts of nearby creatures.  #
8. **Scry** 	You can see through the eyes of a creature you touched earlier today.  #
9. **Swarm** 	You become a swarm of crows, rats, or piranhas. You can only be harmed by blast attacks.  #
10. **Ill Fate** 	Target automatically fails next their next save. @
11. **Epidemic** 	Infects target with disease, which spreads until the source of magic is destroyed. @
12. **Twilight Steed** 	Summons an arcane steed that never tires, but dissipates within daylight. @
13. **Sniff** 	You can smell even the faintest traces of scents.  #
14. **Smoke Form** 	Your body becomes a living smoke that you can control.  #
15. **Hear Whispers** 	You can hear faint sounds clearly.  #
16. **Cure-All** 	A single illness or disease dissipates at your touch. @
17. **Gift of Flight** 	You can fly for a short while. (@)
18. **Fish Lung** 	You can breathe underwater until you surface again. (@)
19. **Vermin Plague** 	Summons a swarm of bats, rats, spiders or similar creatures of your choice. They are harmless but distracting and hold no loyalty towards you or your allies. @
20. **Plant Scourge** 	Plants within eyesight wither and die. @

## Thiefcraft 

These spells have been discovered or passed down in secret from master thief to master thief. They are rarely shared with outsiders.

1. **Disguise**	You may alter the appearance of one character at will as long as they remain humanoid. Attempts to duplicate other characters will seem uncanny. #
2. **Filch** A visible item teleports to your hands.  #
3. **Knock** A nearby mundane or magical lock unlocks loudly.  #
4. **Leap** You jump up to 10ft high, once.  #
5. **Spider Climb** You can climb surfaces like a spider.  #
6. **Energize Rope** A rope-like objects moves at your command. @
7. **Snuff** The source of any mundane light you can see is instantly snuffed out.  #
8. **Thief’s Bane** An object appears trapped, even to an experienced thief. @
9. **Auditory Illusion** 	You create illusory sounds that seem to come from a direction of your choice. #
10. **Shroud** 	A creature you touch is invisible until they move.  #
11. **Mental Tripwire** 	Intruders set off an alarm audible only to you. @

"Knock", "Leap", "Energize Rope" and "Snuff" are the most common ones to encounter. 


## Entertainment

These spells are largely associated with traveling entertainers.

1. **Flare** A bright ball of energy fires a trail of light into the sky, revealing your location to friend or foe.  #
2. **Spectacle** 	A clearly false but impressive illusion of your choice appears, under your control. It may be up to the size of a palace and has full motion and sound.  #
3. **Illuminate** 	A floating light moves as you command.  #
4. **Telekinesis**	You may mentally 1 move item under 60lbs.  #
5. **Firedancer** See below.
6. ***Pass object** You can teleport an object between your hands, your pockets, or another container on your person or within arm's reach, so long as it is not visible at the start or destination.*

Pass object is often used for scamming people, as well.

## Curses, or the magic of the dead

They often come from gods or evil spirits, but mortals can learn to cast them as well. In rare cases, someone who has been truly wronged can call upon one of these at their moment of death. When cast under normal circumstances, they usually dissipate within 1d6 hours, but when cast by a god or a dying mortal they are permanent until the curse can be lifted.

1. **Greed** 	A creature develops the overwhelming urge to possess an item of your choice.  (#)
2. **Hatred** 	A creature develops a deep hatred of another creature or group and wishes to destroy them.  #
3. **Phobia** 	A nearby creature becomes terrified of an object of your choice.  #
4. **Calcify** 	Target object turns to stone at the caster’s touch. Living targets save vs STR. @
5. **Sinister Polymorph** 	WIL save or target is transformed into a harmless animal. @
6. ***Courage** A creature develops a reckless and dangerous fearlessness (inspired by Tannic)*
7. **Sleep** 	A creature you can see falls asleep. As long as they are asleep, they have no need for food, water or other bodily functions. They wake up if they take damage to STR. (#)
8. ***True Name** You (or your next of kin) learn the target's True Name. You know where the target was born, every name they have ever used, and can instinctively sense their location as though you had a compass which points to them.*

Sample NPCs:
- A ghost curses those who sleep by an old battlefield to carry on his long-forgotten battle and to deeply wish to destroy a nearby village and all those who travel there.
- 

## Spells of dominion

Of particular interest to those who wish to rule - either because they grant them power, or because it solves the problems that people expect those in power to have. Often, local authorities expect to maintain a monopoly on these types of spells.

1. **Arcane Confinement** 	Target is bound by magical rope, able only to speak but nothing more. @
2. **Command** 	A target obeys a single three-word command that does not cause it harm. #
3. **Identify Owner** 	Letters appear over the object you touch, spelling out the name of the object’s owners, if there are any.  #
4. **Sense** 	Choose one kind of object (key, gold, arrow, jug, etc). You can sense the nearest example.  #
5. **Raise Spirit** 	The spirit of a nearby corpse manifests and will answer 1 question.  #
6. **Ward** 	A silver circle 50ft across appears on the ground. Choose one species that cannot cross it.  #
7. **Uncurse** 	A person or object you touch is freed from a curse or nefarious spell. @
8. **Magic Dampener** 	All nearby magical effects have their effectiveness halved.  #
9. **Deafen** 	All nearby creatures are deafened. #
10. **Terrify** 	Targets within eyesight must pass a WIL save or flee. @

"Sense", "Identify owner" and "Raise Spirit" are associated with judges, "ward", "uncurse" and "magic dampener" are often also learned by local authorities. However, while these spells are most common, they are still rare: a traveling judge might be responsible for several towns on the basis of knowing just "identify owner".

Sample NPCs:
- Horth, the traveling judge, knows how to identify the true owner of any object. He mostly uses this impressive trick to convince people to sit down and solve their problems honestly, though.
- Kalay, the head priestess, can dig up the old tablets on how to remove various curses, if needed.
- The warlord Xvil is said to be able to force her enemies to flee in terror by merely removing her mask.

## That which makes up the earth

Every part of nature operates because of the efforts of the gods and spirits: you, too, can learn to instruct nature, albeit on a smaller scale. They are fairly rare, though, as they are not always very useful and tend to cause problems for regular people. Someone who can cure a disease is popular; someone who creates earthquakes is not.


Plants
1. **Control Plants** 	Nearby plants and trees obey you and gain the ability to move at a slow pace. #

Everyone that looks at the arrow from 60 feet or closer, including the caster, is blinded for a day, and everyone within 60 feet who doesn't protect their ears is deafened for a day.*

Fire

1. ***Ash** A flammable object you touch crumbles into ash at a rate of one square foot per round from the place it was touched; can be stopped by immersing it in water. Does 1d6 damage to a living creature, and on a critical a limb is permamently burnt and unusable.*

3. ***Heart of Winter** The temperature drops precipitously. Frost forms on all surfaces. Water becomes ice. Anyone within 60 feet must make a DEX check to do anything involving fine motor control or to move fast. Anyone within 10 feet takes 1d8 damage. Critical damage: turned to ice.*


## Self-Knowledge

Some warriors have discovered they can tap into the latent magic that powers all life, including that of mortals. Some unlock these abilities through years of training, through intense contemplation and self-study, or through ecstatic abandon. 

1. **Frenzy** 	You erupt in a frenzy of violence.  (#)
2. **Haste** 	Your movement speed is tripled.  #
3. **Adaptive Skin** 	Target can exist comfortably in hot or cold environments. @
4. **Shield** 	You are protected from mundane attacks for one minute.  (#)
5. ***Firedancer** You wield fire with your bare hands. You deal 1d6 damage, counting as blast damage for everything within touch range, and burn through everything flammable. It stops if you ever stop moving. It also looks really cool.*

## Esoterica

These spells are strange and, unlike other spells, incongruous to the world, unknown to most gods, spirits or other supernatural beings. They have been discovered after generations of study in secret institutions, or perhaps in voyages to the edge of reality.

1. **Astral Prison** An object or being is frozen ouside of time and space in an invulnerable crystal shell. By studying the prison carefully for an extended period of time it is possible to reach in at right angles to reality and pull the object or being out. (#)
