# Trinkets and clothing

When setting up my adventure for Cairn, I read through a bunch of adventures and games I like for ideas on what might improve A Gathering Storm for Cairn. I really like the list of trinkets in Mothership, but it ended up possibly taking up too much space in relation to the content in A Gathering Storm so I split it out and stuck it here.

## Trinkets
1. A single coin of little value from a distant city
2. A locket with a lock of hair
3. A folding pocket brass mirror
4. A worn good luck amulet on a string
5. A small, off-tune whittled flute from a hollow branch
6. A set of sewing needles and thread
7. A folding shrine made of three crudely painted wooden plates
8. A set of tablets with holes in them, used for weaving decorative bands
9. A small vial of spices
10. A set of shell buttons on a string
11. A small wooden animal, half-carved
12. A handful of nails
13. A satchet of dried flowers that smell nice
14. A small shaving kit
15. A carved token from a famous pilgrimage
16. A small wooden board game with tokens
17. An official seal
18. A simple cosmetics kit
19. A comb
20. A portable drop spindle

You don't need one, it can just look cool.

5. A symbol of strength
6. A symbol of beauty

### A different attribute
Add a bit more variety if the 20 table one gets repetitive.  If this clashes with what you rolled, remove the part of the original roll that doesn't make sense.

2. Tattered or worn
3. Elaborate or large
4. Bright or polished
5. Ornate or Elaborate
