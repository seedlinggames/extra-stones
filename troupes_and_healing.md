*This is very much a work in progress.*
# Intro and Context
This works well for playing solo, but probably for one player and one GM as well. It could even work for a conventional party, where you have several characters per player and pick one each session, similar to Blades in the Dark, if you're playing it.

I'm moving towards a game where player characters are relatively disposable, but come out of a larger community which they improve over time. Likely future inspirations will be Stonetop and HOME, though I haven't actually read either of them in full yet.

# Healing
To heal stat damage, a character has to spend time resting. 

One point of damage heals on its own in one day. Two points heal after one day without strenuous activity. More than that, and rest and treatment are required.

To heal more, you have to rest, in bed, with the attention of a healer. It will generally take a week or so. Usually I just have you heal to full after a week. I might experiment with rolling a d6 or something to see how much you heal. What this means in practice is that if a character takes substantial damage, they are probably out for the remainder of the adventure.

# Future directions
I don't know if this would be fun or not, but I feel like if you take sufficient damage, there should be a possibility that you don't make it, even if you get to safety.
