The main character generator for Cairn is good for generating characters that fit the typical adventurer mold of being a bit outside of society. I've been developing system-neutral rules for adventuring as a pro-social part of a broader community, though, and have found that some of the character generation prompts are not quite what I'm looking for.

*This is a work in progress.*

- A change of clothes for the weather. For cold weather? Hot weather? Wet weather? Or fancy clothes?
- A blanket
- Some rope




# Appearance
Roll a distinctive item of clothing from [Trinkes](trinkets.md)

## Notable feature
I find there are too many character traits for me to want to roll them all or for them to all make sense for me. So I've collapsed them into one table of notable characteristics. What about them is most notable?

1. Tall
2. Short
3. Scrawny
4. Stout
5. Tattoed
6. Scarred
7. Bald
8. Long or luxurious hair
9. Disheveled dress
10. Fastidious dress
11. Weathered face
12. Young face

# Values

Roll a few times, and flip a die to see which of a pair it is. Reroll repeats.

Each of these can be seen as good or bad; my goal is that, whatever you may as a player think of the character's values, the character would agree with the characterisation.

1. Boldness vs caution
2. Honesty vs cunning
3. Ambition vs humility
4. Justice vs acceptance
5. Tradition vs novelty
6. Loyalty vs impartiality
7. Mercy vs pragmatism
8. Self-sacrificing vs surviving
9. Propriety vs frankness
10. Passion vs calm
11. Frugality vs extravagance
12. Wisdom vs innocence

Improve relations by one step if you have a matching value.
Reduce by one if they conflict.

2 Violence
3 Verbal hostility
4 Dislike
5 A bit cold
6 Neutral

Or, do this as a ladder thing with a usual bonus to avoid violence. Even with a -1, usually no violence.




## Examples:
Acceptance, propriety, wisdom.
A: This character has seen a lot in life, and been burned many times. They expect neither good nor bad from people, though they always expect the bad, and speak carefully. They will go out and fight monsters, but hold their tongue back in town.


Passion, extravagance, mercy
B: This character spends their coin when they get it, wearing flashy clothes and drinking the best wine they can get. When they are out of coin, they will go and work again - but often they find themselves penniless because they will always help the poor rather than the rich.

A, perhaps, feels protective of B, seeing them as naive and a little foolish, but something of their passion reminds A of their youth. B remembers stories of A before they burned out, and tries to rekindle that spark of idealism.

Cunning, loyalty, novelty
This character is a thief, with a dangerous sense of curiosity, but there is honor among thieves. They will steal from the nobles who travel by, but never from their own community. Their parents despair that they will ever make an honest living, and their antics shock the village elders, but when they


dangers
1 Animal - big
2 Animal - many
3 Supernatural - god
4 supernatural - spirit
5 human - bandit
6 human - kingdom or empire

secondary danger
natural disaster  
lack of food
illness


Rules about food
If you are in a settlement, and there are people around, and you are in good standing, you can earn your keep: Spend most of the day working, and keep up the standard of living to which you are accustomed, including food, shelter, clothing, maintaining the goods that you have, and paying any necessary taxes. You have a few hours a day left over to do things such as talk to people (possibly over a meal) and gather rumors, do research, or build something for yourself.
Most of the time, people operate on a system of barter and obligation, and you don't actually handle money unless traveling.
In addition, you can borrow items from people who you are on good terms will, roll a x check to see if someone has something. You are still limited by your inventory, and if you don't bring it back, you'll owe money + 10% markup (rounded up) for goodwill.
Extra money can be used to acquire rarer goods, improve people's disposition towards you such as by solving problems that can be solved with money.
After a week or more of work, roll d6 to see how much extra money you have left over. You generally do not build up wealth over time through working; it's simply a matter of good fortune how much you have lying around.
Adventuring is how you can improve your lot in life.

Travel
Food is heavy. Living off the land is hard and unreliable (unless you are in an area where people generally live this way, in which case you count as being in a settlement.)
Usually travelers are able to rest at an inn or in a town. AS an adventurer, though, you might go further afield. Still, going more than 3 days away from a settlement is hard. You want to make friends, and barring that, you are probably creating an expedtion with wagons and hirelings.

Having a home base vs always being on the road
A home base could be a house, a wagon caravan, a ship, a horse band. It allows you to own more things than you can carry, as well as allows you to sustain yourself.
You might also have access to storage spaces that fall a bit short of housing. For instance, maybe you range over a wide land during the summer months, but maintain caches or sheds
If you spend substantial time away from this base, travel rules come into effect.
If exiled or forced to flee, you lose access to this and have only what you can carry.

You can convert gold to jewelry that doesn't take a slot. But people will react to you differently
