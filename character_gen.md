# Notes
This section has been tested only in a solo game. In this game, characters are not traditional adventurers, rather they are regular people who happen to live in a place and find themselves forced to solve problems in the world around them. It is more suited to a game that's slightly more character-driven and with more of a focus on relationships with the broader community than a traditional OSR type game.


# Values

I use this instead of Virtues and Vices. I tried to write them so that someone could plausibly see either of the pair as good, and someone else might see them as bad. I personally have my own values and see some of these traits as better or worse, and so do you, most likely, but my intention is that you can roll traits and make a character who sees themselves as good.

They can be interpreted as character traits rather than values. In those cases, they might be seen as negative traits by the character who holds them, that they are trying to overcome.

Roll a d12 and flip a coin or similar. Alternately, sometimes I roll two d12s in different colors. Pick 2 or 3, and figure out how they make a cohesive character. If you roll the same number twice, roll again (so you can only have one of a pair). When picking an NPC that may only appear once, roll just one character trait.

1. Boldness vs caution
2. Honesty vs cunning
3. Ambition vs humility
4. Justice vs acceptance
5. Tradition vs novelty
6. Loyalty vs impartiality
7. Mercy vs pragmatism
8. Self-sacrificing vs surviving
9. Propriety vs frankness
10. Passion vs calm
11. Frugality vs extravagance
12. Wisdom vs innocence

These values can change over time as you play the character.

## Interacting with NPCs
If a player character has a value that matches an NPC and you are known to them by reputation, you are likely to be better disposed to each other. This can apply to a reaction roll, or just through the fiction. If you have two values that oppose each other, you are generally less well disposed to each other.

# Notable feature
I find there are too many character traits for me to want to roll them all or for them to all make sense for me. So I've collapsed them into one table of notable characteristics. What about them is most notable?

I have omitted any that imply anything further about the character's past, so that they can apply to your average local peasant. I might eventually update it to 20 that I like.

If you still want to use the full set for player characters, this could be good for NPCs.

1. Tall
2. Short
3. Scrawny
4. Stout
5. Tattoed
6. Scarred
7. Bald
8. Long or luxurious hair
9. Disheveled dress
10. Fastidious dress
11. Weathered face
12. Young face

# Village Skills
This replaces backgrounds. You come from an ordinary peasant village. What specific task did you do, or what common task did you have an above-average skill at?

1. Herd animals (sheep, pigs, cows).
2. Work metal (blacksmith, tinsmith)
3. Hunting and wild animals
4. Herbalism
5. Hedge-magic
6. Operate a boat: Fishing, ferrying
7. Weave, sew, etc
8. Follow the holy rituals
9. Climb, run, swim
10. Know the old stories

TODO: I'm creating a new starting inventory system around these.
